G                                         D7
Rocking around the Christmas tree at the Christmas party hop
                                                        G
Mistletoe hung where you can see every couple tries to stop
                                           D7
Rocking around the Christmas tree, let the Christmas spirit ring
                                                    G
Later we'll have some pumpkin pie and we'll do some caroling
 
 
C                          Bm
You will get a sentimental feeling when you hear
Em                             A7                  D7
Voices singing let's be jolly, deck the halls with boughs of holly
G                                          D7
Rocking around the Christmas tree, have a happy holiday
                                                  G
Everyone dancing merrily in the new old-fashioned way

G            Gmaj7        G6          G
Jingle bell, jingle bell, jingle bell rock
                       Am           D7
Jingle bells swing and jingle bells ring
Am          D7         Am         D7
Snowing and blowing up bushels of fun
D                  Am    D7
Now the jingle hop has begun
 
[Song becomes Jingle Bell Rock]
 
G            Gmaj7        G6          G
Jingle bell, jingle bell, jingle bell rock
                      Am          D7
Jingle bells chime in jingle bell time
Am          D7          Am          D7
Dancing and prancing in Jingle Bell Square
Am     D      G
In the frosty air
 
[Chorus]
 
       C                     Cm
What a bright time, it's the right time
   G               G7
To rock the night away
       A              A7
Jingle bell time is a swell time
   D  D7           D         D7
To go gliding in a one-horse sleigh
 
[Verse 3]
 
G        Gmaj7         G6           G
Giddy-up jingle horse, pick up your feet
                  E7
Jingle around the clock
C       Cm            A7       Cm
Mix and mingle in the jingling beat
Am         D           G
That's the jingle bell rock
 

[Back to Rockin' around the christmas tree]
 G                                         D7

Mistletoe hung where you can see every couple tries to stop
                                           D7
Rocking around the Christmas tree, let the Christmas spirit ring

Voices singing let's be jolly, deck the halls with boughs of holly
G                                         D7
Rocking around the Christmas tree, have a happy holiday

Everyone dancing merrily in the new old-fashioned way
